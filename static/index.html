<h1>Welcome to PyChee</h1>

PyChee is a lightweight Apache/Python framework that was written over the course of a sporadic weekend. Its aim is to be a lightweight python deployment for exporatory development, designed to host a number of projects on disparate subdomains.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>PyChee is hosted on github. Get it at <a href="http://github.com/philippp/PyChee">http://github.com/philippp/PyChee</a>!</p>

Prerequisites:
<ul>
  <li>Apache 2</li>
  <li>mod_python</li>
  <li>Python 2.6+</li>
  <li>Cheetah</li>
</ul>

Modify the PythonPath cited in .htaccess to your project root, and you should be good to go.

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>0.1 (Weekend one, 11/22/09)</h3>
Currently PyChee forces each controller to reference a single template, with a routing of /foo calling the index() method of controllers/foo.py and rendering views/foo.tmpl.
A simple "Hello world" is implemented through controllers/hello.py and views/hello.tmpl, stop by <a href="http://pychee.notphil.com/hello?who=pychee">http://pychee.notphil.com/hello/?who=pychee</a> and check it out.
Immediate goals include routing for methods, so that a routing of /foo/bar will call the bar() method of controllers/foo.py and attempt to render views/foo/bar.tmpl

<h3>0.2 (Weekend two, 11/28/09)</h3>
It's thanksgiving weekend, so I don't expect to get too much work done on this. We are now resolving routes past the controller name to the method (ex: /foo/bar calls the bar() method of controllers/foo.py). This behavior can be modified by overriding the dispatch() function in controllers/__init__.py. 
Immediate goals include switching mod_python out for mod_wsgi.
